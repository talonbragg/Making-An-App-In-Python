# how-to-make-a-GUI-app-in-python
This is a tutorial on how to make a basic GUI app in Python.

The first thing that you need to do when creating a Graphical User Interface in python, is initialize the window. This is how I do it in three lines of code

```python
import Tkinter as tkinter

window = tkinter.Tk()

window.mainloop()
```

Then you should see something like this when you run the python:

`Image goes here`
